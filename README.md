I did this little project to dip my toes in the world of NLP! I will try to add more to this to help it distinguish spam vs ham better. I used BoW (bag of words).

The initial dataset used:
Almeida, T. & Hidalgo, J. (2011). SMS Spam Collection [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5CC84.
